# Solva — Product Positioning

This document defines how **Solva** is positioned, described, and framed publicly.

It exists to keep messaging clear, consistent, and focused as the product evolves.

---

## Positioning Statement

**Solva** is a simple scheduling and client-management app for **solo cleaning businesses** who want an easy way to manage bookings without complex systems.

Solva is designed for daily use, not setup-heavy configuration or enterprise workflows.

---

## Who Solva Is For

Solva is built for:
- Independent cleaning operators
- Solo service providers
- Owner-operators managing their own schedules

Typical users:
- Work alone
- Have repeat clients
- Offer a small set of services
- Want a clear view of upcoming work
- Do not want to spend time learning software

---

## Who Solva Is Not For

Solva is **not** positioned for:
- Teams or multi-staff businesses
- Agencies or franchises
- Marketplace-style platforms
- Businesses needing invoicing, payroll, or CRM-heavy systems
- Users who want deep automation or integrations

This focus is intentional.

---

## Core Value Proposition

Solva helps solo cleaners:
- See what’s coming up
- Remember client details
- Reuse common services
- Stay organised day to day

The value is **clarity**, not optimisation.

---

## Key Differentiators

Solva stands apart by being:

- **Calm**  
  Minimal interface, low cognitive load.

- **Opinionated**  
  Clear defaults instead of endless options.

- **Focused**  
  One primary use case, done well.

- **Lightweight**  
  No unnecessary features, accounts, or complexity.

---

## Messaging Tone

Solva’s tone should always be:
- Clear
- Practical
- Grounded
- Quietly confident

Avoid:
- Buzzwords
- Growth hype
- “All-in-one” claims
- Enterprise or startup jargon

---

## Language Guidelines

Prefer language that is:
- Human
- Direct
- Simple

Examples:
- “Manage your bookings”
- “See your day at a glance”
- “Keep notes on clients”
- “Set up once, use daily”

Avoid:
- “Optimise”
- “Scale”
- “Leverage”
- “Powerful platform”

---

## Positioning Over Time

Solva’s positioning may broaden in the future, but only after:
- The core product is stable
- The cleaning use case is proven
- The foundation supports modular growth

Until then, Solva remains intentionally narrow.

# Solva — Simple Scheduling for Solo Service Businesses

**Solva** is a lightweight scheduling and client-management app built for solo operators and small service businesses who want clarity, not complexity.

The initial focus is **cleaning businesses**, where repeat bookings, simple services, and clear daily workflows matter most. Other niches (such as dog walking) are supported as examples, with broader modularisation planned for later versions.

Solva is designed to be calm, opinionated, and practical — a tool you can open every day without friction.

## Why Solva

Most scheduling tools are built for teams, marketplaces, or large operations. Solva is intentionally different:

- Built for **solo operators**
- Focused on **daily use**, not configuration
- Clear defaults instead of endless settings
- Lightweight and easy to understand

The goal is not to be everything — it’s to be reliable and usable.

## Project Status

### v1.0 — Prototype (Archived)
An early exploratory build used to test structure, flows, and feature ideas.  
This version is preserved for reference and learning.

### v1.1 — Active Development
A cleaned-up rebuild with a tighter scope and clearer positioning:
- Cleaning-first workflows
- Reduced feature set
- Improved structure and maintainability
- Foundation for future niche modules

---

## What’s Included (v1.1)

- Booking creation and management
- Client list with notes
- Service setup (cleaning-focused)
- Availability and schedule settings
- Simple dashboard view

### Intentionally Out of Scope
- Team scheduling
- Invoicing or payments
- Marketplace features
- Heavy integrations
- Over-customisation per niche

---

## Design Principles

Solva is built around a few simple ideas:

- **Calm by default**  
  Minimal UI and low cognitive load.

- **Opinionated structure**  
  Good defaults over endless configuration.

- **Modular by design**  
  Niche variations come later, without rewriting the core.

- **Practical over clever**  
  The app should feel obvious to use.

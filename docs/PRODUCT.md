# Solva — Product Definition

This document defines what **Solva** is, what it is becoming, and what it is deliberately *not*.

It is a living document and will evolve as the product matures.

---

## Product Summary

Solva is a simple scheduling and client-management app designed for **solo cleaning businesses**.

It focuses on helping a single operator manage:
- Bookings
- Clients
- Services
- Daily workload

Solva prioritises clarity, speed, and calm over feature depth or automation.

---

## Background

### v1 — Prototype Phase

The initial version of Solva was an exploratory prototype.

Its purpose was to:
- Test layout and navigation ideas
- Explore multiple service-based use cases
- Gather early feedback
- Understand where complexity emerged

v1 successfully clarified *what not to build*.

---

### v1.1 — Product Rebuild

v1.1 marks a deliberate shift from exploration to **product definition**.

The focus is now:
- One clear use case (cleaning)
- Fewer features
- Stronger structure
- A foundation that can grow without rewrites

This version is about getting the **core right**.

---

## Target User

Solva is built for:
- Solo cleaning operators
- Independent service providers
- Small, owner-operated businesses

Typical characteristics:
- One person running bookings and work
- Repeat clients
- Predictable services
- Limited time to manage tools

Solva assumes no technical background.

---

## Core Problems Solva Solves

- Keeping track of upcoming jobs
- Remembering client details and preferences
- Reusing common services without re-entry
- Understanding the day or week at a glance
- Reducing mental overhead around scheduling

Solva does **not** aim to optimise revenue, marketing, or growth at this stage.

---

## Core Capabilities (v1.1)

- Create and manage bookings
- Store clients and notes
- Define reusable services
- Set basic availability
- View upcoming work in a simple dashboard

Each feature must support **daily use**, not edge cases.

---

## Non-Goals (For Now)

Solva intentionally avoids:
- Team or staff scheduling
- Payments or invoicing
- Marketplace features
- Complex automation
- Industry-specific customisation beyond cleaning

These are future considerations, not current objectives.

---

## Design Principles

Solva is guided by a small set of principles:

- **Calm first**  
  The interface should feel quiet and manageable.

- **Opinionated defaults**  
  Fewer choices, better outcomes.

- **Local-first thinking**  
  Data should be understandable and predictable.

- **Modular growth**  
  Future expansion should layer on, not rebuild.

---

## Looking Ahead

Once the core product proves stable, future exploration may include:
- Refinement based on real usage
- Optional modules
- Broader service-based applicability
- Improved onboarding and clarity

No commitments are made at this stage.

This document exists to keep the product focused as it evolves.

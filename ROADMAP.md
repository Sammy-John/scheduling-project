# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the **direction** of Solva, not a fixed delivery schedule.

Solva is being developed iteratively, with scope driven by clarity, real usage, and maintainability rather than feature volume.

---

## Current Focus — v1.1

**Objective:**  
Establish a clean, reliable foundation for solo cleaning businesses.

**Focus areas:**
- Core booking workflows
- Client management with notes
- Service setup and reuse
- Simple, calm daily-use UI
- Clear internal structure for future growth

At this stage, the priority is **correctness and usability**, not expansion.

---

## Near Term (Post v1.1)

Once the v1.1 foundation is stable:

- Refine booking flows based on real usage
- Improve first-run clarity and onboarding
- Polish client and service management
- Reduce friction in common daily actions
- Expand documentation and internal consistency

These improvements will be incremental and focused.

---

## Future Considerations

These areas are intentionally deferred until the core product proves stable:

- Optional modular features
- Niche adaptations beyond cleaning
- Deeper automation
- Data export and reporting
- Integration with external tools

No commitment is made to timelines or inclusion.

---

## What This Roadmap Is Not

- Not a feature promise
- Not a release schedule
- Not a marketing list

It exists to communicate **intent**, not pressure development.

---

This roadmap will evolve as Solva matures and real-world use informs decisions.
